            How It Works

          <Typography variant="body1">
            Volunteers can browse through our curated list of volunteer

            and sign up for activities that align with their interests and
            availability. Our platform makes it easy for volunteers to connect
            with organizations and groups, track their volunteer hours, and stay
            informed about upcoming events and initiatives.
